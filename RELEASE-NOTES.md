Popover:
Updated Popover max width. We made maxWidth optional (#2110)
Enabled highlighting and selecting text in popover (#1757)
Handled on enter focusing when options are disabled (#2025)
Changed PopoverPosition from a const to an enum. This allows users to specify their choice of a string or object property for the position property value on Popover component. Also adds a test that exercises this method to ensure it doesn't regress going forward. (#2113)
Select:
Updated the SelectProps interface to avoid a type error when importing react-core into a TypeScript application. I also removed some unnecessary code in a couple of the demo's I followed recently. Copying the code as is was creating an error. I think they were safe deletions but worth double checking. (#2107)
Fixed ListGroupItem import (#1867)
Added user personalized icon in Select component (#1768)
